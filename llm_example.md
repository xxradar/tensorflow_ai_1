## This script does the following:

- **Imports necessary modules**: TensorFlow and some specific layers and utilities for processing text.

- **Prepares the data**: It uses a simple string `text` as its dataset. In a real-world scenario, you would use a much larger and more complex dataset.

- **Tokenizes the text**: This converts the text into sequences of integers, where each integer represents a specific word.

- **Creates n-gram sequences**: This is important for training a language model, as it needs to learn the probability of a word given the previous words.

- **Pads the sequences**: This ensures that all sequences are of the same length.

- **Splits the data into predictors and labels**: The model will learn to predict the next word in a sequence.

- **Builds a Sequential model**: The model uses Embedding, GRU (a type of RNN), and Dense layers.

- **Compiles the model**: It uses categorical crossentropy as the loss function, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.

- **Trains the model**: The model is trained for 100 epochs. You might need to adjust the number of epochs based on your specific dataset.
